# giphynberg

When two great powers combine, [giphy](https://giphy.com/) and [gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg), you get giphynberg! This is a demo block to show how it is easy and fun to make custom blocks for gutenberg, and was part of a talk I am giving for the [Bend WordPress Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Bend-WordPress-Meetup/).

## Things That Aren't Awesome About This

This is a demo plugin and really has not been the zenith of coding nor accessiblity standards and it is dreadfully not localized. I beg for forgivness from the WordPress coding standards! I opted to do this in plain 'ol JavaScript, though I prefer ES6... trying to make it legible to most folks. If you would like, please do submit a PR - that would be neat. You can open issues too... not as neat, but go for it.

Also "my" API Key is in this repo for Giphy. You can get one yourself for free, or find many other Giphy API keys in code examples around the web. Not a best security practice? Perhaps - am I concerned about this, not really :)

## Things That ARE AWESOME

You can use this block to search giphy gifs, and insert them into your posts. Giphy is the duct tape of the internet. Awesomesauce! PSA: And I fear I must remind you all that the .gif file extension is not pronounced like a popular peanut butter brand.
