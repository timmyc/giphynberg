giphynberg is a block for gutenberg that helps you pick the prefect gif from giphy for use in your posts.

== Description ==
When two great powers combine, [giphy](https://giphy.com/) and [gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg), you get giphynberg! This is a demo block to show how it is easy and fun to make custom blocks for gutenberg, and was part of a talk I am giving for the [Bend WordPress Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Bend-WordPress-Meetup/).

== Installation ==
This plugin requires Gutenberg to be installed. Once Gutenberg and this plugin is installed, you will need to add a Giphy API Key ( https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/?create=true ), and set the option under Tools | Giphynberg. You can now add awesome Giphy gifs to your posts.
